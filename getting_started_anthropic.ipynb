    "# Your First Chat with AI\n\nWelcome! In this notebook, we'll send a message to Anthropic's **Claude** AI and see what it says back \u2014 just like chatting, but through code.\n\n### What you'll do\n- Set up everything you need (just a few clicks!)\n- Send a message to the AI\n- Get a response back\n\n### Before you begin\n- A Google account (you're on Colab, so you have one!)\n- An Anthropic API key \u2014 think of it as a **password** that lets your code talk to the AI. We'll get one in the next step.\n\n---"

Sign up or sign in with your account\n3. Click **\"Create Key\"** to generate a new API key\n4. Copy the key \u2014 you'll only see it once!\n\n---"

In the left sidebar of this notebook, click the **key icon** (Secrets)\n2. Click **\"Add new secret\"**\n3. Set the **Name** to: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n4. Paste your API key as the **Value**\n5. Toggle the **\"Notebook access\"** switch to **ON**\n\n> **Why not just paste the key in the code?** If you share this notebook with someone, they'd be able to see and use your key. Secrets keep it hidden.\n\n---"
